This project is kind of jekyll, but not much, more .html & .css.

Everything content-related is to be edited in respective chapters in \_includes\chapters.
Used plots (.htmls exported from pltoly) are then to be placed in \_includes\plots.
If some images (.png, .jpg, .svg) are needed to be used, place in \assets\images.
