        The gender gap in the movie industry is not limited to the representation of characters on screen, but also extends to the recognition and opportunities afforded to those working behind the scenes. For example, the Academy Awards,
        considered as one of the most prestigious awards in the film industry, honors not only actresses or actors but also directors, songwriters or movie engineers. The plot below shows the number of male and female nominees at the Academy Awards in various categories.
        It indicates that there is a potential gender bias in the movie industry, as the number of male and female nominees is not balanced. It is worth noting that in many categories, the number of female nominees is significantly lower compared to their male counterparts. 
        In fact, in only a few categories, such as costume design and makeup and hairstyling, is the number of male and female nominees roughly comparable.

        It is important to acknowledge that while the overall trend may show an improvement in the representation of women in the Academy Awards nominees, 
        it is crucial to examine the representation of women within specific categories. For example, while the number of women nominated for all categories
        may have increased over time, the representation of women in behind-the-scenes roles may still be disproportionately low.

        Statistical tests were conducted in order to determine if there was a gender gap in certain categories of the Academy Awards.
        The results of the test show that there is no significant difference between the number of men and women who win in the categories that were 
        analyzed. This means that men and women have an equal chance of winning in these categories. Overall, it is encouraging to see an improvement 
        in the representation of women in the Academy Awards nominees, but this does not necessarily mean that there is no gender gap in these categories. 
        To fully understand if there is a gender gap, it would be necessary to consider more factors and examine a wider range of data.
